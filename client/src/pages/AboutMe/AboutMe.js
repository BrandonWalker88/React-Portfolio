      <p>
        I am a software engineering student in Georgia Techâ€™s coding bootcamp.
        The goal is to work for a meaningful company that does good for the
        community. The dream is to work for Amazon on there prime air project. I
        currently work as an AEMT for Grady EMS. I enjoy serving the community
        of Atlanta and am looking forward to a rewarding job in a field that can
        impact lives in a positive way. I am proficient in: HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, Node, Mongo DB, MySQL, Bootstrap, and React. In my free time
        I like to go backpacking and kayaking.
